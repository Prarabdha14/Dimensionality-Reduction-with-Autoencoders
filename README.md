Key Insights:

Dimensionality Reduction: Demonstrates the effectiveness of Autoencoders in reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving important information.
Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction: Explores the ability of Autoencoders to capture non-linear relationships in the data, which may not be effectively captured by linear methods like PCA.
Feature Extraction: Explores the use of Autoencoders for feature extraction, where the learned latent space representations can be used as input for other machine learning models.
